The Lannisters’ association with the Iron Throne would prove ill-fated,
for the Red Kraken and his reavers fell upon the undefended westerlands whilst Lord Jason marched east at
King Aegon II’s behest.

Princess Rhaenyra’s supporters met his host at the crossing of the Red Fork,
where Lord Jason fell in battle, mortally wounded by the grizzled squire Pate of Longleaf
(knighted after the battle, this lowborn warrior would be known as the Lionslayer for the rest of his days).
The Lannister host continued to march, winning victories under Ser Adrian Tarbeck, and then under Lord Lefford,
only to fall by the thousands at the Fishfeed, caught between three armies.
